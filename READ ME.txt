Inspiration
We chose this topic because the mother of a team member works with those with speech impairments, and we also looked at a few examples of what was currently in the app store to serve those with Aphasia. We found the apps were very cluttered and people with Aphasia would not be able to navigate the apps.

What it does
The App provides a very simple interface for the patient. The therapist can sign in and provide their credentials, and after that, tapping on the app takes the patient directly to the language comprehension improvement grades. We were also intending to upload the patient's progress to a website that would be accessible by the doctor. We created a database and a website, but there were extensive difficulties connecting the swift code to MySql.

Challenges we ran into
The greatest challenge we ran into was trying to link MySql with our Xcode app, as well as trying to stay awake to complete everything by 8. Both challenges got the better of us.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our app is functional and robust, with features like auditory and visual feedback, adaptive difficulty, and a framework that would easily be able to upload key data to a database.

What we learned
We learned a great deal of swift code an became much for familiar with the Xcode environment. We learned about alternate, easier ways to connect an iOS app to my SQL like javascript or using a Java wrapper. We learned about some of the subtle differences in code designed to work on Linus and Unix machines and how the terminal could be used to perform actions that can't be done in Xcode, like executing files that would be orthogonal to the program. We learned about the functionality of MySql, and how it interacts with AWS.
